You are at a office and you accidently leave the window open and moths/bugs
start coming in. So you pull out a flyswatter and start killing them. You think its
going to be easy but you are horribly wrong and your drunk.

Implementations:
You randomly teleport
Moths will dissapear
You get two flyswatters, one is real, one is fake
You have an offset when swinging flyswatter
